# 🍺 Brew to Success  
*A storytelling data analysis project from the Applied Data Analysis (ADA) course at EPFL*  

A collaborative project exploring what makes a **beer popular**, using data from **BeerAdvocate** and **RateBeer**.  
We present the results of our course project in an **interactive storytelling website** that reveals insights about beer characteristics, seasonality, and consumer preferences.

## 🌟 Motivation

Brewing the perfect beer is a craft of endless possibilities.  
Our mission was to cut through the flood of reviews and extract meaningful insights — ultimately recommending the **best combination of beer characteristics for each month of the year**.  

We asked:  
- What constitutes a *popular beer*?  
- Do consumer preferences change with the seasons?  
- Which attributes — alcohol content, location, aroma, taste, appearance, palate — matter most?  

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Popularity defined**: A beer is “popular” if it gathers many *good ratings* (above-average) and maintains a high average score.  
- **Regional focus**: To avoid seasonal mismatches across hemispheres, we focused on reviews from the **United States**, where most ratings originated.  
- **Seasonality**: Beers show clear popularity peaks — e.g., **Oktoberfest** in October, fruity beers in summer, and strong dark ales in winter.  
- **Alcohol by Volume (ABV)**: Lower ABVs are favored in summer, while higher ABVs dominate the colder months.  
- **Location**: U.S. breweries — especially California — overwhelmingly dominate monthly top beers.  
- **Keywords analysis**: Seasonal descriptors like *pumpkin* (fall), *citrus* (summer), and *honey* (winter) emerged as strong indicators of popular beers.
