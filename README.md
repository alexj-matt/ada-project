# üç∫ Brew to Success  
*A data analysis project from the Applied Data Analysis (ADA) course at EPFL*  

A collaborative project exploring what makes a **beer popular**, using data from **BeerAdvocate** and **RateBeer**.  
We present the results of our course project in an **interactive storytelling website** that reveals insights about beer characteristics, seasonality and consumer preferences.

## üåü Motivation

Brewing the perfect beer is a craft of endless possibilities.  
Our mission was to cut through the flood of reviews and extract meaningful insights to ultimately recommend the **best combination of beer characteristics for each month of the year**.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

We combined **time series analysis, statistical testing, and keyword analysis** to uncover trends in beer ratings.  
Key dimensions explored:

- **Seasonality:** examined how beer popularity fluctuates across months.  
- **Attributes studied:**  
  - Beer Styles (Oktoberfest, American Pale Ale, etc)
  - Alcohol by Volume (ABV)  
  - Geographic location of breweries  
  - Review keywords (aroma, taste, appearance, palate)

## üìä Key Insights

- **Popularity definition**: A beer is ‚Äúpopular‚Äù if it gathers a good average (overall) rating with a substantial number of excellent ratings.
- **Consumer focus**: To avoid seasonal mismatches across hemispheres, we narrowed analysis to the **United States**, the largest and most consistent user base.
- **Seasonality**: Beers show clear popularity peaks, like **Oktoberfest** in October, fruity beers in summer and strong dark ales in winter.  
- **Alcohol by Volume (ABV)**: Lower ABVs are favored in summer, while higher ABVs dominate the colder months.  
- **Location**: U.S. breweries, especially California, overwhelmingly dominate monthly top beers.  
- **Keywords analysis**: Seasonal descriptors like *pumpkin* (fall), *citrus* (summer) and *honey* (winter) emerged as strong indicators of popular beers.
